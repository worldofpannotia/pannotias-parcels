## Introduction

This mod contains various items intended to go with the [World of Pannotia modpack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/world-of-pannotia). It also serves as a place for me to learn the basics of modding.

## Features

The mod currently features a number of blocks useful for decoration as well as storing large quantities of common materials.

* Bamboo, cane, and stick bundles: made with 9 of their respective materials, these blocks can be placed in much the same way as hay bales.
* Compressed blocks (up to 4x): made with 9 of their respective materials (or 9 of the previous compression level), these blocks are useful for storing massive amounts of common blocks.
  * Cobblestone
  * Dirt
  * Gravel
  * Sand
  * Stone

## Credits

Obviously this mod would not be possible if not for the people at Mojang making an awesome game. In addition, many
